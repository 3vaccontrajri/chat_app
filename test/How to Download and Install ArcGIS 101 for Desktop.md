## Step 1: Download ArcGIS 10.1 for Desktop
 
To download ArcGIS 10.1 for Desktop, you need to have an Esri Global Account. If you do not have one, you can create one for free at [https://accounts.esri.com/](https://accounts.esri.com/). After logging in with your Esri Global Account, go to [https://appsforms.esri.com/products/download/](https://appsforms.esri.com/products/download/) and select ArcGIS 10.1 for Desktop from the list of available software. You can choose between Basic, Standard or Advanced edition depending on your license level and needs. You will also need to provide some information about your organization and accept the license agreement before downloading the software.
 
The download file is a zip file that contains two files: setup.exe and setup.msi. The size of the zip file is about 1 GB, so make sure you have enough space on your download directory and a stable internet connection.
 
## Step 2: Extract and Install ArcGIS 10.1 for Desktop
 
After downloading the zip file, you need to extract it to a folder on your computer. You can use any extraction tool such as WinZip or 7-Zip to do this. Make sure you have write access to your extraction folder and that no one is accessing it.
 
To start the installation process, run the setup.exe file from the extraction folder. You will see a welcome screen that offers you the option to start the installation after the files have been extracted or to manually launch the setup program later. Choose the first option if you want to proceed with the installation immediately or the second option if you want to install it later.
 
During the installation, you will need to read and accept the license agreement, choose a predetermined set of installation features (complete) or only the specific features required for your installation (custom), select an installation location or use the default one, and configure a Concurrent or Single Use authorization depending on your license type. You can refer to [https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/installation-guide/installing-on-your-computer.htm](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/installation-guide/installing-on-your-computer.htm) for more details on each step of the installation.
 
The installation may take several minutes depending on your system configuration and the features you selected. When the installation is complete, you will see a message that confirms it and prompts you to restart your computer if necessary.
 
## Step 3: Enjoy ArcGIS 10.1 for Desktop
 
After installing ArcGIS 10.1 for Desktop, you can launch it from the Start menu or from a shortcut on your desktop. You will need to activate your license before using the software. You can do this by running the ArcGIS Administrator Wizard from the Start menu or from the installation folder. You will need to provide your license number or connect to a license manager depending on your license type.
 
Once you activate your license, you can start using ArcGIS 10.1 for Desktop to create, analyze and share maps and geographical data. You can also access online resources such as tutorials, documentation, forums and blogs from within the software or from [https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/).
